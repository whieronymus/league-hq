shrink_players.py
Filter a large Sleeper players.json down to only:
- The player IDs actually present in your league's rosters JSON
- A concise subset of useful fields

Outputs: reduced_players.json

Usage:
  python shrink_players.py --players /path/to/players.json --rosters /path/to/rosters.json --out /path/to/reduced_players.json

Notes:
- The rosters file should be a JSON array like the example the user shared
  (one object per team with "players" and "starters" arrays).
- The players file should be the big Sleeper players.json { "<id>": { ... }, ... }.
